Solution - 

FIRST Create a left join as it will have both the visit_id of both Visits and transactions table.
Then in WHERE clause, use subquery to find which elements are not in transactions, then group them by customer_id, and 
in Select query the customer_id and count(*) of all tables

  # Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT customer_id, count(*) as count_no_trans
FROM Visits v
Left JOIN Transactions t
ON v.visit_id = t.visit_id
WHERE v.visit_id NOT IN (SELECT visit_id FROM Transactions)
GROUP BY customer_id
