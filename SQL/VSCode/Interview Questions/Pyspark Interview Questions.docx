Explain the concept of a junk dimension and when you would use it.
Describe the pros and cons of using a snowflake schema versus a star schema.
How would you design a dimension to handle hierarchical data?

Q1 What is a Star Schema and how does it differ from a Snowflake Schema?
Ans - A Star Schema is a data warehouse schema that consists of a central fact table surrounded by dimension tables. A Snowflake Schema is a more normalized version of a Star Schema, where each dimension table is further divided into multiple related tables.

Q2 What is the difference between a Fact Table and a Dimension Table?
Ans - A Fact Table stores measurable data, such as sales or revenue, whereas a Dimension Table stores descriptive data, such as date, time, or geography.

Q3 What is Data Aggregation and how is it used in a Data Warehouse?
Ans - Data Aggregation is the process of grouping and summarizing data to provide a higher level of detail. In a Data Warehouse, aggregation is used to improve query performance and provide faster access to data.

Q4 What is Data Partitioning and why is it used in a Data Warehouse?
Ans - Data Partitioning is the process of dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces. It is used in a Data Warehouse to improve query performance, reduce data loading times, and make maintenance easier.

Q5 What is the difference between a Type 1 and Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)?
Ans - A Type 1 SCD overwrites old data with new data, while a Type 2 SCD creates a new record for each change, preserving historical data.

Q6 What is the difference between SQL normal Views vs. Materialized Views?
Ans - SQL Views are virtual tables derived from SQL queries and do not store data physically. They fetch data dynamically from base tables, ensuring the most current data is always presented. This makes them ideal for simplifying complex queries, providing data abstraction, and enhancing security by restricting access to specific data.
Materialized Views, on the other hand, store the query results physically, offering precomputed data for faster read operations. They require periodic refreshes to ensure data accuracy. These views are particularly useful for improving performance in complex queries and storing aggregated data for quick access.

Q7 How can I address data skewness using repartitioning?
Answer: Repartition the DataFrame by a column with high cardinality to ensure more balanced data distribution.
PySpark Code - df = df.repartition("columnName") # Use a column with High cardinality

Q8 What is the process for salting to mitigate data skewness?
Answer: Add a salt function to distribute the data more evenly and create a new key.
PySpark Code - 
from pyspark.sql.functions import col, expr
df = df.withColumn("salt", expr("floor(rand() * num_salts)"))
df = df.withColumn("new_key", col("columnName") + "_" + col("salt"))


Q9 How can I optimize joins to reduce data skewness?
Answer: Use broadcast for smaller tables to join with high cardinality performance.
from pyspark.sql.functions import broadcast
PySpark Code - df = df.join(broadcast(small_df), "join_column")


Caching Vs Persist

Interviewer: You have 2 minutes. Explain the difference between Caching and Persisting in Spark.

➤ 𝗖𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Caching in Apache Spark involves storing RDDs in memory temporarily. When an RDD is cached, its partitions are kept in memory across multiple operations, allowing for faster access and reuse of intermediate results.

➤ 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴:

Persisting in Apache Spark is similar to caching but offers more flexibility in terms of storage options. When you persist an RDD, you can specify different storage levels such as MEMORY_ONLY, MEMORY_AND_DISK, or DISK_ONLY, depending on your requirements

➤ 𝗞𝗲𝘆 𝗱𝗶𝗳𝗳𝗲𝗿𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗲𝗲𝗻 𝗰𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴:

- While caching stores RDDs in memory by default, persisting allows you to choose different storage levels, including disk storage. Caching is suitable for scenarios where RDDs need to be reused in subsequent operations within the same Spark job.
- whereas persisting is more versatile and can be used to store RDDs across multiple jobs or even persist them to disk for fault tolerance.

➤ 𝗘𝘅𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝘄𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝘄𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘂𝘀𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘀𝘂𝘀 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴

- Let's say we have an iterative algorithm where the same RDD is accessed multiple times within a loop. In this case, caching the RDD would be beneficial as it would avoid recomputation of the RDD's partitions in each iteration, resulting in significant performance gains. 
- On the other hand, if we need to persist RDDs across multiple Spark jobs or need fault tolerance, persisting would be more appropriate.

➤ 𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗦𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗸 𝗵𝗮𝗻𝗱𝗹𝗲 𝗰𝗮𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀𝗶𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘂𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗿 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗵𝗼𝗼𝗱

Spark employs a lazy evaluation strategy, so RDDs are not actually cached or persisted until an action is triggered. When an action is called on a cached or persisted RDD, Spark checks if the data is already in memory or on disk. If not, it calculates the RDD's partitions and stores them accordingly based on the specified storage level.

1. Coding Questions: Pyspark:
You've been given some CSV files like karnataka.csv and maharashtra.csv in an ADLS location, each containing columns for first_name, last_name, age, sex, and location.
Your task is to add a new column called state to each DataFrame. The state column should contain the state name extracted from the filename.
For example:
For karnataka.csv, the state column should contain the value 'karnataka'.
For maharashtra.csv, the state column should contain the value 'maharashtra'.
Your solution should utilize PySpark to efficiently handle large-scale data processing tasks.

2. Coding Question: Python/ DSA:
A. Reverse a string without using reverse function
B. Write a python program to implement following. Given a pattern and a string. If string matches the pattern return true else return false. 
Ex: 
Pattern – “abba”, String – “dog cat cat dog” will return true. 
Pattern – “aba”, String – “dog dog cat” will return false.

3. Coding Question: SQL
Find the 3-month rolling average of total revenue from purchases given a table with users, their purchase amount, and date purchased (YYYY-MM-DD). Output the year-month (YYYY-MM) and 3-month rolling average of revenue, sorted from earliest month to latest month.

Fractal Interview Questions
The Problem: You are given a DataFrame df with student data, which includes their names and cumulative GPAs. The DataFrame schema includes columns like student_name and cumulative_gpa.
Tasks:
1.Find the maximum, minimum, and average cumulative GPA from the DataFrame.
2.Determine the student with the highest GPA and the student with the lowest GPA.
3.Count the number of students whose GPA matches the rounded average GPA.
4.Create a new DataFrame with a schema containing the names of the students with the highest and lowest GPAs, as well as the count of students with the average GPA.
5.Display this new DataFrame.

from pyspark.sql.functions import col, max, min, avg, round

# Finding the max, min, and average GPA
max_gpa = df.select(max(col("cumulative_gpa"))).collect()[0][0]
min_gpa = df.select(min(col("cumulative_gpa"))).collect()[0][0]
avg_gpa = df.select(round(avg(col("cumulative_gpa")), 2)).collect()[0][0]

print(max_gpa, min_gpa, avg_gpa)

# Determining the students with the highest and lowest GPAs
max_student = df.filter(col("cumulative_gpa") == max_gpa).select("student_name").collect()[0][0]
min_student = df.filter(col("cumulative_gpa") == min_gpa).select("student_name").collect()[0][0]

# Counting the number of students with the rounded average GPA
avg_count = df.filter(col("cumulative_gpa") == avg_gpa).count()

# Creating a new DataFrame with the required schema
schema = ("top_name string, last_name string, avg_count int")
data = [[max_student, min_student, avg_count]]
final_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema)

# Displaying the new DataFrame
display(final_df)
