SOlution - 

  I have used window function as opposed to the solution, it was easier for me 

    # Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH CTE AS (
    select id, name AS Employee , salary, departmentId ,
    DENSE_Rank() OVER(PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS rnk 
    FROM Employee )

 SELECT Department.name AS Department ,
    Employee ,
    Salary
 FROM CTE
 LEFT JOIN Department 
 ON CTE.departmentId  = Department.id 
 WHERE rnk <= 3
