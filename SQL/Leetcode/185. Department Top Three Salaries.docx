SOlution - 

  I have used window function as opposed to the solution, it was easier for me 

    # Write your MySQL query statement below
WITH CTE AS (
    select id, name AS Employee , salary, departmentId ,
    DENSE_Rank() OVER(PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY SALARY DESC) AS rnk 
    FROM Employee )

 SELECT Department.name AS Department ,
    Employee ,
    Salary
 FROM CTE
 LEFT JOIN Department 
 ON CTE.departmentId  = Department.id 
 WHERE rnk <= 3 

Pyspark solution  - 
from pyspark.sql import *
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Department Top 3 Salary").getOrCreate()

window = Window.partitionBy(col("df_Employee.departmentId")).orderBy(col("df_Employee.salary").desc())

df_cte = df_Employee.select("id", col("name").alias("Employee"), salary, departmentId)\
                     .withColumn("rnk", dense_rank().over(window))
df_cte = df_cte.filter(col("rnk")< = 3)

df_result = df_cte.alias("cte")\
               .join(df_Department.alias("d"), on = (col("cte.departmentId") == col("Department.id")), "left")
df_result = df_result.select(col("d.name").alias("Department"), col("Employee"), col("Salary"))

df_result.write.parquet("filepathc")
