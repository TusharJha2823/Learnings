Solution 1 - using window function

My SQL -   
  SELECT person_name FROM (SELECT person_name, turn, sum(weight) OVER (order by turn) as cum
    FROM Queue) AS p1
  WHERE cum< =1000 ORDER BY turn DESC LIMIT 1;

MS SQL - 
  SELECT TOP (1) person_name FROM (SELECT person_name, turn, sum(weight) OVER (order by turn) as cum
    FROM Queue) AS p1
  WHERE cum< =1000 ORDER BY turn DESC;

SOLUTION 2 - using joins
  SELECT q1.person_name
  FROM Queue q1 
  INNER JOIN Queue q2
  ON q1.turn >= q2.turn
  GROUP BY q1.turn
  HAVING SUM(q2.weight) <=1000
  ORDER BY SUM(q2.weight) DESC
  LIMIT 1;
