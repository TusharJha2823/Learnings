  SELECT c.visited_on,
    (
      SELECT SUM(amount) 
      FROM Customer c3
      WHERE c3.visited_on 
        BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY)
        AND c.visited_on
    ) AS amount,
    ROUND(
      (
        SELECT SUM(amount) 
        FROM Customer c3
        WHERE c3.visited_on 
          BETWEEN DATE_SUB(c.visited_on, INTERVAL 6 DAY)
          AND c.visited_on
      ),2) AS average_amount
  FROM Customer c
  WHERE c.visited on > = (
    SELECT DATE_ADD(MIN(c2.visted_on), INTERVAL 6 DAY)
    FROM Customer c2
  )
  GROUP BY c.visted_on
  ORDER BY c.visited_on;

SOLUTION FOR MS SQL - 

  SELECT c.visited_on,
    (
      SELECT SUM(amount) 
      FROM Customer c3
      WHERE c3.visited_on 
        BETWEEN DATEADD(day, -6, c.visited_on)  -- important method for date function in tsql
        AND c.visited_on
    ) AS amount,
    ROUND(
      (
        SELECT SUM(amount) / 7.00  -- USE this way for average as the cast of avg doesn't work, it will distort the answer
        FROM Customer c3
        WHERE c3.visited_on 
          BETWEEN DATEADD(day, -6, c.visited_on)
          AND c.visited_on
      ),2) AS average_amount
  FROM Customer c
  WHERE c.visited on > = (
    SELECT DATEADD(day, 6, MIN(c2.visited_on))
    FROM Customer c2
  )
  GROUP BY c.visted_on
  ORDER BY c.visited_on;
