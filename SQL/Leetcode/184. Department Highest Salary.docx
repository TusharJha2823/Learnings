SOLUTION - 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT e.*,
        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY departmentId ORDER BY salary DESC) as rn
    FROM Employee e
)
SELECT d.name AS "Department",
    CTE.name AS "Employee",
    CTE.salary AS "Salary"
FROM CTE 
LEFT JOIN Department d
ON CTE.departmentId = d.id
WHERE rn = 1

Pyspark solution  - 
from pyspark.sql import *
spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("Department Highest Salary").getOrCreate()

window = Window.partitionBy(col("df_Employee.departmentId")).orderBy(col("df_Employee.salary").desc())

df_rnk = df_Employee.withColumn("rn", rank().over(window))

df_rnk_1 = df_rnk.where(col("df_rnk.rn") == 1)

df_result = df_rnk.alias("cte").join(df_Department.alias("d"), on = (col("cte.departmentId") == col("d.id")), "left")

df_result = df_result.select(col("d.name").alias("Department"), col("cte.name").alias("Employee"),col("cte.salary").alias("Salary"))

df_result.write.parquet("filepath")
