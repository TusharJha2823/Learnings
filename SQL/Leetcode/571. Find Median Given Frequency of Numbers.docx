SOLUTION - 

SELECT AVG(t3.Number) AS median
FROM Numbers AS t3
JOIN
  (SELECT t1.Number,
          ABS(SUM(CASE WHEN t1.Number > t2.Number THEN t2.Frequency ELSE 0 END) -
              SUM(CASE WHEN t1.Number < t2.Number THEN t2.Frequency ELSE 0 END)) AS count_diff
   FROM Numbers AS t1, Numbers AS t2
   GROUP BY t1.Number) AS T4
ON t3.Number = T4.Number
WHERE t3.Frequency >= T4.count_diff
