Problem URL - https://leetcode.com/problems/employee-bonus/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50

Solution - 
In this the question asks for bonus less than 1000 but also wants to include the Null values, so beware of that

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */

Select e.name, bonus
FROM Employee as e
LEFT JOIN Bonus as b
ON e.empId = b.empId
WHERE bonus < 1000
OR bonus IS NULL;
