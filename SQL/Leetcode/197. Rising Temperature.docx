Problem URL - https://leetcode.com/problems/rising-temperature/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50

Solution Logic - Use a self join on Weather table and then find the difference between the dates if equal to 1, then check if the temperature of table 1 is greater than table 2

Solution - 

SELECT w1.id
FROM Weather w1, Weather w2
WHERE DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
AND w1.temperature > w2.temperature
