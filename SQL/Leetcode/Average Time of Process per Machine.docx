Solution - 
In this question we use self join as we have only 1 table. 


Select a.machine_id as machine_id, ROUND(AVG(b.timestamp - a.timestamp),3) AS processing_time 
FROM Activity a -- Use self join to make 2 tables for the substraction
JOIN Activity b
ON a.machine_id = b.machine_id  
-- We need to match on both values as it will allow us to make the substraction, 
AND a.process_id = b.process_id
WHERE a.activity_type = 'start' AND b.activity_type = 'end'
GROUP BY a.machine_id;;
