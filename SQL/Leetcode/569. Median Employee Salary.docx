SELECT t1.Id AS EmployeeId, t1.Company, t1.Salary
FROM Employee AS t1
JOIN Employee AS t2
  ON t1.Company = t2.Company
GROUP BY t1.Id, t1.Company, t1.Salary
HAVING SUM(CASE 
             WHEN t2.Salary < t1.Salary THEN 1
             WHEN t2.Salary > t1.Salary THEN -1
             WHEN t2.Salary = t1.Salary AND t2.Id < t1.Id THEN 1
             WHEN t2.Salary = t1.Salary AND t2.Id > t1.Id THEN -1
             ELSE 0 
           END) <= 1
ORDER BY t1.Company, t1.Salary, t1.Id;


Explaination - 

Self-Join: The Employee table is joined with itself to compare each employee’s salary against others within the same company.
Group By: Groups the results by employee ID, ensuring each employee’s data is aggregated separately.
Having Clause: Filters groups to include only those employees who have at most one other employee with a higher salary, and at most one with a lower salary.
Order By: Orders the results by company, salary, and employee ID for readability.
