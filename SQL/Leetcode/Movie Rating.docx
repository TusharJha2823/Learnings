NOTE : - UNION removes duplicate rows, UNION all keeps duplicate rows, Also I have used the extract function as a means of practice, you can use the month and year functions as usual. 
  The question is tricky, here the trick is to first create groups based on user_id/movie_id, and then in order by we put the count/avg and to get the highest value we use the descending function, then name/title s ascending

SOLUTION - 

# Write your MySQL query statement below
(SELECT u.name AS results
FROM MovieRating mr1
LEFT JOIN Users u
USING (user_id)
GROUP BY mr1.user_id
ORDER BY count(rating) DESC, u.name LIMIT 1)

UNION ALL
(
SELECT title AS results
FROM MovieRating mr2
LEFT JOIN Movies m
USING (movie_id)
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM created_at) = 2 
AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM created_at) = 2020
GROUP BY mr2.movie_id
ORDER BY AVG(rating) DESC, title
LIMIT 1)
