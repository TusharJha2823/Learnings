Solution 1 - using self join (This for some reason doesn't work with sql server)

# Write your MySQL query statement below
Select e1.name
FROM Employee e1
Join Employee e2
ON e1.id = e2.managerId
GROUP BY e2.managerId
HAVING count(e2.managerId)>=5

Solution 2 - Using subquery - 

Select name
From Employee
Where id in (
  Select managerId 
  from Employee 
  Group By managerId
  Having COUNT(managerID) > 4 )
