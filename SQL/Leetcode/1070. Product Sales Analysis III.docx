  Solution 1 - #My-SQL

SELECT s.product_id,
       s.year as first_year,
       s.quantity,
       s.price
FROM Sales s
WHERE (s.product_id, s.year) IN (
         SELECT s1.product_id, MIN(s1.year) 
         FROM Sales s1
         Group by s1.product_id);
  


  Solution 2 - 
  /* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT year,
         product_id,
         Row_Number() OVER (Partition BY product_id ORDER BY year, product_id) AS rnk
  FROM Sales
)
SELECT s.product_id,
       s.year as 'first_year',
       s.quantity,
       s.price
FROM Sales s
INNER JOIN CTE
ON S.year = CTE.year
AND S.product_id = CTE.product_id
WHERE CTE.rnk = 1;
